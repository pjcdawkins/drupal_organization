# Organization

Allows users to define and manage organization profiles.

Organizations are implemented as a bundle on the 'user' entity. This means that
they have a UID, and as such they can "own" content, Commerce orders, etc. in
the same way that a normal user account can. However, organizations cannot log
into the site - they are owned and managed by regular users.
